*This project will be about showing the comparison of Gasoline prices between Mexico's Federal Entities. 
*The idea is to show the prices of each Federal Entity and determine if the gasoline prices in the selected state is above or below the national average.  
*For now we have data base from the CRE, the data shows the historic prices from 2017 to 2020 of the different types of Gasoline and Diesel in each state.

Chart Ideas:
*Bubble Chart showing prices between Entitites (Month Prices)
*GAUGE CAGE to show prices between Entities (Entity Average)
*Tendency Line Chart showing historical prices
*HeatMap between Entities to show price 
*Scatter Plot to show price dispersion

Library JS
*TBD
